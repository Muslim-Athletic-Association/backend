### MODEL
This folder contains all of the logic that's needed to interact with the model (in this case, the database). Rather than creating objects and interacting with them, we interact with tables and their rows directly. We have a module named constants that handles all necessary database interactions. This module should be imported into all modules that require database interaction.
